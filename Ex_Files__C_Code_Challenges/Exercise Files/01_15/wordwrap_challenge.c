Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\n\
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, \
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;\n\
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, \
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\n\
And every fair from fair sometime declines, \
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\n\
But thy eternal summer shall not fade, \
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\n\
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, \
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:\n\
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, \
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.";
